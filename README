Scottish Technical Standards

Scottish Ministers are responsible for Building Standards in Scotland 
with the key purpose of protecting the public interest, creating Building 
Regulations and preparing technical guidance to ensure buildings are safe, 
efficient and sustainable for all.Both the domestic and non domestic 2011 
Technical Handbooks have now been consolidated to include publication errata 
and the changes brought about by the Building (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 
2011. These versions now include the new Section 7: Sustainability alongside 
minor changes to the technical guidance.

The Technical Handbooks provide guidance on achieving the standards set in 
the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004 and are available in two volumes, 
Domestic buildings and Non-domestic buildings.Changes have been made to 
the guidance in the 2011 Technical Handbooks that will apply from 3 October 
2011. These changes are in respect of Section 2: (Clarifying fire and rescue 
water supplies), Section 3: (Radon mapping) and Section 4 (Protective barriers). 
The handbooks were consolidated in May 2011 for minor changes, publication 
errata and Section 7: Sustainability.The Individual Technical Handbook 
sections, and previous yearly editions, can be accessed via the link below. 
Hard copies of the 2010 handbook can be ordered through 'The Stationery Office'. 
The handbooks published prior to 2009 came into force on the May 1 of the respective year.
